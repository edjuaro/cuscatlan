# cuzcatlan
*Historical note: Cuzcatl√°n is how the natives called what is now El Salvador. The Nahuatl suffix "-tlan" is a place/location and the root of the word has found multiple spelings using roman characters Cuzca, Cusca, and Kozcatl (to list a few) was a word used to reffer to good things. Hence it is believed that the Pipil people would reffer to their land as "The Place From Where Good Things Are Found."*
